This script is a simple port scanner.
 It prompts the user to input a website URL, 
 starting port, and ending port. It then iterates through a range of ports, 
 calling the scan_port function for each port. The scan_port function attempts to establish a new socket, 
 connects to the specified port on the host, and prints whether the port is open or closed.
