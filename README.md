Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanner script written in Ruby. 
It prompts the user to enter a website URL, a starting port, and an ending port. 
It then iterates over the range of ports and calls the scan_port function for each port. 
The scan_port function attempts to create a new socket, connect to the specified port on the host, 
and then prints whether the port is open or closed.
How to Use

    Run the script: ruby port_scanner.rb
    Enter the website URL (e.g., example.com)
    Enter the starting port
    Enter the ending port

The script will then scan the specified range of ports for the given website URL. 
Please note that this script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.
